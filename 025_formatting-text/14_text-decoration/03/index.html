<!-- The HTML Deleted Text Element (<del>) represents a range of text that has been deleted from a document.  -->

<!-- The HTML Strikethrough Element (<s>) renders text with a strikethrough, or a line through it. Use the <s> element to represent things that are no longer relevant or no longer accurate. However, <s> is not appropriate when indicating document edits; for that, use the <del> and <ins> elements, as appropriate. -->
