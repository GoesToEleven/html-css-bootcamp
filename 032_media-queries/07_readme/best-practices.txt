Mobile First
-Build your pages to look good on mobile first
-Then add in break-points so that your pages work at larger resolutions

Breakpoints based upon content
-Create your breakpoints based upon your content
-Have your content look good, and be readable, at different sizes

70 - 80 characters of text per line
-Classic readability theory suggests that an ideal column should contain 70 to 80 characters per line (about 8 to 10 words in English)
-When the width of a text block grows past about 10 words, a breakpoint should be considered

Putting media queries in your link tag is the preferred method
-Allows your code to be more modular and readable
-Only pulls down the needed code for each page

Use
min-width
max-width
min-height
max-height

Don’t use
max-device-width
min-device-width
max-device-height
min-device-height

Create breakpoints based on content, never on specific devices, products, or brands.

Design for the smallest mobile device first, then progressively enhance the experience as more screen real estate becomes available.

Keep lines of text to a maximum of around 70 or 80 characters. Classic readability theory suggests that an ideal column should contain 70 to 80 characters per line (about 8 to 10 words in English). Thus each time the width of a text block grows past about 10 words, a breakpoint should be considered.
